This is a vorticity particle (vorton) simulation of unconstrained fluid dynamics for video games.

It is based on the work of Dr. Michael J. Gourlay at Intel, as described in 
<http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/fluid-simulation-for-video-games-part-1/>. 

In general, this is fast enough and precise enough to be used in realtime on commodity multicore computers.

However, it is *not* a physically accurate simulation. There are many, many places where the
dynamics are fudged in order to ease implementation or improve performance.

This simulation should not be used for engineering, product design, or scientific analysis. It's for putting
pretty stuff on the computer screen.
